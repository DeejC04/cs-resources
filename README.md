# Computer Science/Programming/Etc Learning Resources

This document should serve as a simple, easy to read starting point for learning computer science and related subjects. Note that this list is not comprehensive, and may be missing some things. Also note that sufficient research and diligence will be required alongside most, if not all of the resources listed.

## Courses

### Introductory CS
#### *Excluding language-specific teaching (syntax, proprietary features), each of these courses should be nearly equivalent in terms of content taught. Programming logic remains the same, regardless of language, so you should not have too much trouble if a following course is taught in a different language. Though, it may be ideal to stick with the same one for a bit for the sake of consistency.*

- **Harvard CS50X** - Introduction to Computer Science
- **U.C. Berkeley CS61A** - The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- **Brown CS0150** - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science
- **Stanford CS106A or CS106B or CS106X**
    - Each of these three are considered introductory CS courses. There are slight differences between the three as outlined on Stanford's website. "**CS106B** assumes you have programming experience at the level of **CS106A**" and "**CS106B** and **(CS106)X** are somewhat similar, though X is an accelerated version of the course. **(CS)106X** covers the same material as **(CS)106B**, but at a much faster pace and at a deeper level". Thus, if you are completely new, I recommend going with **CS106A** then proceeding into **CS106B**/**CS106X** depending on how comfortable you are with the content.
